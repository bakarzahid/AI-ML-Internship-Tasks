# ❤️ Task 3 – Heart Disease Prediction

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

---

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Name:** Heart Disease UCI Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Target Variable:** `target` (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)  
- **Features:** age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, etc.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- **Correlation Heatmap:** To show relationships between features  
- **Histograms/Boxplots:** For feature distribution and outlier detection  
- **Confusion Matrix:** For classification results  
- **ROC Curve:** For model performance  
- **Feature Importance Plot:** To highlight key predictors

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Features like chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and ST depression (`oldpeak`) are strong indicators of heart disease risk.
- The model predicts heart disease risk with good accuracy.
- ROC curve and confusion matrix help evaluate model performance and error types.
