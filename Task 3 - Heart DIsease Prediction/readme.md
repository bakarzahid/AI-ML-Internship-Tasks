Task 3 – Heart Disease Prediction
🎯 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease using health-related data.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
📂 Dataset Details
Source: Heart Disease UCI Dataset (Kaggle)
Type: Tabular, medical data
Target Variable: target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)
Features: Age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, etc.
⚙️ Workflow Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values (if any)
Convert categorical variables if needed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize feature distributions
Analyze relationships between features and target
Identify trends and potential outliers
Model Training:

Train a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)
Evaluation:

Assess model using accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix
Feature Importance:

Identify and visualize the most important features affecting prediction
📊 Visualizations Included
Histograms & Boxplots: For feature distribution and outlier detection
Correlation Heatmap: To show relationships between features
ROC Curve: For model performance
Confusion Matrix: For classification results
Feature Importance Plot: To highlight key predictors
