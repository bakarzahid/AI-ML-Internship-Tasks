## 🎯 Objective

Predict the **next day's closing price** of a selected stock using historical data and machine learning models.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3  
- yfinance  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib

---

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Source:** Yahoo Finance (via yfinance library)  
- **Stock Example:** Apple (AAPL)  
- **Features Used:** `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`  
- **Target Variable:** Next day's `Close` price

## ⚙️ Workflow Steps

1. **Data Fetching:** Download historical stock data using yfinance  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Use current day's features to predict next day's close  
3. **Model Training:** Train Linear Regression and Random Forest models  
4. **Prediction:** Predict closing prices on test data  
5. **Visualization:** Plot actual vs predicted closing prices
